## OWL_Translator
#OWL to CL/FOL translator
This is a translation tool implemented as part of my undergrad thesis.

It takes an ontology written in web onlogy language (OWL) to first order logic in either prover9 or cl syntax. This facilitate 
inductive logic inference.

Or reversly, it translate FOL to OWL (beta).
