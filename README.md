## Ontology_Translator
This repository contains various translation tools for different ontology language such as rdf, owl, first order logic (fol or in), common logic (CL or clif). This project is originated from my undergrad thesis. The only avaiable translation software that I am aware of is the Macleod tool, but it only runs on Linux redhat and no longer maintained. 

This project is aimed to provide a light weight translator for research purpose.

#OWL to CL/FOL translator

It takes an ontology written in web onlogy language (OWL) to first order logic in either prover9 or cl syntax. This facilitate 
inductive logic inference.

Or reversly, it translate FOL to OWL (beta).
